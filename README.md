LifeLine: AI Fall Detection & Instant Emergency Voice Connection

LifeLine is an advanced smart device designed to enhance elderly safety by detecting uncontrolled falls and providing immediate assistance. The system integrates ESP32, motion sensors, audio ICs, and AI algorithms to deliver real-time monitoring and emergency communication.

üõ† Hardware Overview

Microcontroller: ESP32 handles sensor data acquisition, AI fall detection, and communication.

Accelerometer: ADXL345 (or similar) continuously monitors motion and acceleration to detect abnormal movements indicative of a fall.

Audio System: INMP441 MEMS microphone and MAX98357 audio amplifier IC enable real-time two-way voice communication with the emergency contact.

Power Supply: Internal rechargeable battery ensures autonomous operation with low-power modes.

Communication: Wi-Fi or ESP-NOW provides instant notifications and voice connection to a pre-defined phone number or device.

üß† Software & AI Algorithm

On-board AI algorithm analyzes accelerometer data in real-time to distinguish between normal activity and fall events.

Low-latency detection ensures emergency contacts are notified immediately.

Upon detecting a fall, the ESP32 automatically initiates a voice call or audio link, allowing instant assessment and assistance.
